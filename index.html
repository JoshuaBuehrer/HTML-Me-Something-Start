        <h2>Apple</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Apples</b> (though thought to be a more of a vanilla and basic
          fruit) have a magic power of repelling doctors away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly vampires are repelled by garlic, thus it has come to my
          attention that doctors are in fact <b>VAMPIRES!</b><br />
          Think about it, why else would they constantly be asking for our
          blood?! Why do they put you in a dark room with no windows?! <br />
          It was believed that Dracula ( <em>famous vampire</em>) was a master
          in science and medicine!

          For having an impressive ability to deter doctors, I give the

        <a name="Pear"></a>
        <h2>Pear</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Pears</b> (though Similar to <b>Apples</b>) carry no special
          properties, but it is this similarity that fascinates me. <br />
          Much like like how the <em>Scarlet King Snake</em> mimics the
          <em>Eastern Coral Snake</em> to deter any predetors, <br />
          the <b>Pear</b> has evolved into mimicing the <b>Apple</b> to deter
          doctors

        <h2>Watermelon</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Watermelon</b> is a tricky one. considered by many to be the
          <em>Holy Grail</em> of fruit. <br />
          one must master the art of picking the correct one.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many people have come up with theorys on how to pick the best one.
          Some say "You got to pick the hard ones", <br />
          other say "The greenest ones are the best". I don't think we will ever
          truly know the answer, it will remain one of lifes biggest mysteries.
          <br />
          There's a certian rush you get from the gamble of picking the correct
          <b>Watermelon!</b> Will this one taste good or bad?! Only fate will
          decide. <br />
          with the sweet taste of a good <b>Watermelon,</b> (<em
            >and my crippling gambling addiction</em
          >).
